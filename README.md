# Flows Over Periodic Hills of Parameterized Geometries
### A Dataset for Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling From Direct Simulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For data-driven turbulence modeling, we need benchmark data from systematically and continuously varied flow conditions (e.g., Reynolds number and geometry) with maximum coverage in the parameter space. To this end, we perform direct numerical simulations of flows over periodic hills with varying slopes, resulting in a family of flows over periodic hills which ranges from incipient to mild and massive separations.
